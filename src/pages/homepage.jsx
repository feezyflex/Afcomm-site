          <br />
          <p className="text-base text-justify">
            In the bustling heart of Lagos, Nigeria, a vision for a safer, more
            connected city took root over 20 years ago. This vision gave birth
            to Afcomm Technology, a company that has since become synonymous
            with cutting-edge security and communication solutions in West
            Africa's largest metropolis.

          <b className="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold text-center">Our Humble Beginnings</b>
          <br />
          <p className="text-base text-justify">
          Founded in the early 2000s by a group of passionate engineers and
          security experts, Afcomm Technology started as a small shop in the
          vibrant streets of Lagos. Our founders recognized the growing need for
          reliable security systems in both residential and commercial spaces as
          the city expanded rapidly.

          <p className="text-base text-justify">
          What set Afcomm apart from the beginning was our commitment to staying
          ahead of technological advancements. We weren't content with just
          selling products; we wanted to provide integrated solutions that would
          truly make a difference in people's lives and businesses. As we grew,
          so did our expertise. From our initial focus on intercom systems, we
          expanded our services to include:

          Our reputation grew not just through our sales, but through our
          dedication to quality installations and prompt repairs. We understood
          that in the world of security, every second counts. This philosophy
          led us to build a team of highly trained technicians who could respond
          swiftly to our clients' needs.
